# CSCI321-Final-Project
A short game made in CSCI 321 with two other partners using Unity. I worked AI scripts as well as some level building while my partners focused on UI, sound, and level building. Lion model was retextured by me, the hydra model was edited and animated by me, and the crab model was also animated by me.
A build of the game has been uploaded to Itch.io which you can find here: https://barrynn.itch.io/the-12-labours-of-hercules
